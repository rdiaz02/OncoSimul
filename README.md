# OncoSimul



Code for forward population genetic simulation in asexual populations,
with special focus on cancer progression.  Fitness can be an arbitrary
function of genetic interactions between multiple genes or modules of
genes, including epistasis, order restrictions in mutation accumulation,
and order effects.  Mutation rates can differ between genes, and we can
include mutator/antimutator genes (to model mutator
phenotypes). Simulations so far use continuous-time models and can include
driver and passenger genes and modules. Also included are functions for:
simulating random DAGs of the type found in Oncogenetic Trees, Conjunctive
Bayesian Networks, and other cancer progression models; plotting and
sampling from single or multiple realizations of the simulations,
including single-cell sampling; plotting the parent-child relationships of
the clones; generating random fitness landscapes (Rough Mount Fuji, House
of Cards, and additive models, and NK model) and plotting them.



The /OncoSimulR directory contains the code for the [BioConductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) package
[OncoSimulR](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/OncoSimulR.html). The
/miscell-files directory contains additional files so far only related to
the above.


A former version of this code has been used in the paper "Identifying
restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor
progression: effects of passengers, evolutionary models, and
sampling",
[BMC Bioinformatics, 2015, 16:41](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/16/41).
OncoSimulR has also been used extensively in the simulations reported in
the Bioinformatics 
paper
["Cancer Progression Models And Fitness Landscapes: A Many-To-Many
Relationship"](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx663) and the PLoS
Computational Biology paper 
["Every which way? On predicting tumor evolution using cancer progression
models"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007246).

New functionality to allow for **frequency-dependent fitness has been
added**. See the freq-dep-fitness branch: https://github.com/rdiaz02/OncoSimul/tree/freq-dep-fitness

# Installation


To use the most recent code in BioConductor, install the devel version.

```r
if (!require("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("OncoSimulR", version = "devel")

```


<!-- <\!-- that I regard as stable you first need to [use -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- a development version of Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/useDevel/). Most -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- of the time, from R you only need to do: -\-> -->


<!-- ```r -->
<!--     library(BiocInstaller)  -->
<!--     useDevel() -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Then the next code will install the development version of the package and -->
<!-- its dependencies, if needed: -->


<!-- ```r -->
<!--     source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") -->
<!--     biocLite("OncoSimulR") -->
<!-- ``` -->

To start using it:

```r
library(OncoSimulR)
```



You can directly install from github (and this might be newer than the
BioC code)

```r
install.packages("devtools") ## if you don't have it already
library(devtools)
install_github("rdiaz02/OncoSimul/OncoSimulR")
``` 

But sometimes the latest additions in this repo could be broken (see [Software status](#software-status)). And you
can of course clone this repo, and install from there.

## BioConductor github repository

The github repository for this package is this one:
https://github.com/rdiaz02/OncoSimul . Since mid-2017 BioConductor is
maintained using git, but since this directory contains other files and
directories in addition to the OncoSimulR package itself, I have not used
option ["Sync an existing GitHub repository with
Bioconductor"](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git/sync-existing-repositories). Instead,
I continue using this github repo, but then locally update a
Bioconductor-only repository of just the OncoSimulR code (as explained in
[Maintain a Bioconductor-only repository for an existing
package](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git/maintain-bioc-only/)).

# Documentation


As any R/BioConductor package, OncoSimulR comes with documentation for its
user-visible functions and data sets (using the help is just standard R
usage). From
[OncoSimulR's BioConductor page](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/OncoSimulR.html)
you have access to the standard documentation both the manual and overview
---the vignette. The best place to start is the vignette (created from the
`OncoSimulR/vignettes/OncoSimulR.Rnw` file that includes both text and
code).

<!-- you can obtain the  -->
<!-- [PDF reference manual](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.2/bioc/manuals/OncoSimulR/man/OncoSimulR.pdf). A -->
<!-- better place to start, though, is the long vignette, with commented -->
<!-- examples (and created from the `OncoSimulR/vignettes/OncoSimulR.Rnw` file -->
<!-- that includes both text and code). Here is -->
<!-- [the vignette as PDF](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/OncoSimulR/inst/doc/OncoSimulR.pdf), -->
<!-- from the BioConductor site (the development branch). -->


You can view the vignette from R itself doing


```r
browseVignettes("OncoSimulR")
```

and this gives you access to the HTML, the Rmd file (markdown + R), and the R code.

## Documentation: HTML and PDF for this repo's version


From these two links you can also
[browse the HTML vignette](https://rdiaz02.github.io/OncoSimul/OncoSimulR.html)
and [get a PDF version](https://rdiaz02.github.io/OncoSimul/pdfs/OncoSimulR.pdf).

These files correspond to the most recent, github version, of the package
(i.e., they might include changes not yet available from the BioConudctor
package).


## Further documentation

This [paper published in
Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx077) gives a
quick overview of OncoSimulR (a former version is available as a [bioRxiv
preprint](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/14/069500)). You can
also take a look at this [poster presented at ECCB
2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.7490/f1000research.1112860.1). A chapter titled
"Simulating evolution in asexual populations with epistasis" will appear
in K.-C. Wong (ed.), Epistasis: Methods and Protocols. Methods in
Molecular Biology, later during 2020; here is a [preprint
version](https://repositorio.uam.es/bitstream/handle/10486/690422/simul_evol_epist_preprint_v3_with_figures.pdf).


If you use the package in publications **please cite the Bioinformatics paper**.

The frequency-dependent fitness functionality is based on [Sergio
Sanchez-Carrilo's Master's
thesis](https://repositorio.uam.es/handle/10486/685417) (see also file
['miscell-files/Sergio_Sanchez-Carillo-improvements-post-TFM.pdf'](miscell-files/Sergio_Sanchez-Carillo-improvements-post-TFM.pdf)
for additional features that were not described in the original
thesis). Additional functionality has been added by Juan Antonio Miguel
Gonz√°lez.

The authors are S. Brouillet, G. Achaz, S. Matuszewski, H. Annoni, and
L. Ferreti. I downloaded the sources on 2019-06-05 from
http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/magellan/latest.tgz. The code is under
the GPLv3. MAGELLAN is "an integrated tool to visualize and analyze
fitness landscapes of small dimension (up to 7-8 loci)". In OncoSimulR we
use only a very limited subset of the functionality of MAGELLAN (mostly to
generate different types of random fitness landscapes and to compute
statistics of epistasis); the `Makevars` file we use only compiles two of
the executables (`fl_statistics` and `fl_generate`) ---the directory
`src/FitnessLandascape` contains, however, the complete sources. Note also
that the plots of fitness landscapes used in OncoSimulR are actually
blatantly copied in looks from MAGELLAN's plots.

(and corresponds to the [exprTk

https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk/commit/9fad72832c70348725c073e369a3321781001766). The
file was originally named `exprtk.hpp`; to conform to R's requirements, it
was renamed as `exprt.h`


The code in `miscell-files/randutils.h` is copyright Melissa E. O'Neill,

The file randutils.hpp was downloaded from
https://gist.github.com/imneme/540829265469e673d045 on 2015-06-20 and is
also referenced from the main article [Ease of Use without Loss of Power]
(http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/ease-of-use-without-loss-of-power.html). I
renamed it to randutils.h to conform to R's requirements (and changed the
`auto exit_func = hash(&_Exit);` line to keep R from complaining about the
Exit function). I had to disable usage of randutils for now, since I could
not get it to compile with gcc-4.6 (since version 3.3 of R, 
the official Rtools for Windows now support C++-11, so I might change 
this in the near future).

(Note: Appveyor can fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the
package, such as R not being downloaded correctly, etc. Look at the
details of each failure. Similarly, some of the errors in BioConductor,
specially in the development branch, can be caused, specially in Windows,
by some required packages not being yet available, often "car" and
"igraph". <!--            Finally, some failures in Travis can be caused by timeouts in -->
<!-- the coverage tests ---tests that run in about 5 minutes on my laptop, but -->
<!-- can occasionally apparently take longer than the maximum time for jobs -->
<!-- under Travis. --> Again, look at the details of each failure.)
