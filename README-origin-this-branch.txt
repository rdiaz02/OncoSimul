The "GERMÁN" branch


Note that I accidentally pulled this into master. I reverted that and added it here as:

(The branch had already been created from master)

git checkout for_pr_prstr_2022_23_group_5
git pull https://github.com/JavierGC08/OncoSimul.git GERMÁN
git push

(This is my reading of the "do the pull request from command line" from github itself)
