Description: Functions for forward population genetic simulation in
    asexual populations, with special focus on cancer progression.
    Fitness can be an arbitrary function of genetic interactions between
    multiple genes or modules of genes, including epistasis, order
    restrictions in mutation accumulation, and order effects.  Simulations
    use continuous-time models and can include driver and passenger genes
    and modules.  Also included are functions for simulating random DAGs
    of the type found in Oncogenetic Tress, Conjunctive Bayesian Networks,
    and other tumor progression models, and for plotting and sampling from
    single or multiple realizations of the simulations, including
    single-cell sampling, as well as functions for plotting the true
    phylogenetic relationships of the clones.
