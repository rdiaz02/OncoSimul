	code added.
	- Fixed non-working code in metrics due to changes in functions in graph. 
	- Added simple code for temporal order.
	- Added old code for clonal ordering (not finished).
	- Robustified other functions and start up (cbn, metrics,
	plotting, etc).
	- No dependencies on libgmp (multiprecission arith.) now; removed
	from Makevars.
	- Warning in R code if endTimeEvery is not negative in simulation models
	where it should probably be negative. 

preBioC_1.0.19	2014-xxx
	- Changes and addition to plotting functions.
	- Added comparison of adjacency matrices and other miscell
	functions from the processing code of the simulations.
